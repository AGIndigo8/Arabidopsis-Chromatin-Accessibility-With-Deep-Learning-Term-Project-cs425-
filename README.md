# Arabidopsis-Chromatin-Accessibility-With-Deep-Learning-Term-Project-cs425-

This is an exploration of deeplearning approaches to predicting chromatin accessibility in various arabodopsis cell types.
We use multi-task classification to predict across 5 cell types. We join read data from various experiments and transform them into 1-hot encoded sequences around the peaks.

My contributions to this collaborative project are those up to but not including the portion dedicated to SEI.
